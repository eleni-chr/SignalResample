# SignalResample
Use interpolation to resample a signal with a new sampling rate.

Function written by Eleni Christoforidou in MATLAB R2022b.

This function takes as input a [1 x N] signal x and sampling frequency xFs, as well as a resampling frequency yFs. The function uses linear interpolation to create and output signal y, a resampled version of x with sampling rate yFs.
